TODO:

* Optionally set mtime for systems other than RCS (get info from log).
  Make it optional for RCS (it currently forces -mtime to be set).

* Support Mecurial/hg.

* Apply more options to all forms of repository:
  * -bytimestamp/bydate, -utc, -raw
  * -last n

* Recognize more numeric options, perhaps up to -9
